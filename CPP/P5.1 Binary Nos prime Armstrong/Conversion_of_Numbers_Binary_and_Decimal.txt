To convert a number from binary to decimal,
We represent the number as a sum of power of two
Ex. 45 = 1x2pow(5) + 0x2pow(4) + 1x2pow(3) + 1x2pow(2) + 0x2pow(1) + 1x2pow(0)
.
To convert a number from decimal to binary,
We divide the number by two and keep storing the remainder till we reach a zero quotient.
